### Hi, I'm Erin! 👋

I'm passionate about exploring innovative tech solutions and sharing insights in AI, cloud infrastructure, and financial optimization.

#### 🚀 AI Agents
- Experimenting with tools like [Browser-Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) and frameworks like [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) and Langchain to automate tasks, synthesize information, and enable multi-agent collaboration for research, learning, and workflow optimization.

#### ☁ Cloud Infrastructure
- Creating visualizations for cloud components, clarifying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Bicep and Pulumi, simplifying monitoring, and providing educational resources for accessible cloud management.

#### 💲 FinOps
- Implementing cost optimization strategies such as resource right-sizing andreserved instances, building dashboards for monitoring and analysis, automating cost controls, and fostering cultural best practices for cloud financial management.

💡 **Connect & Collaborate:**

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, discuss interesting projects, and collaborate on innovative ideas. Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, or just say hello!
